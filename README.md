Hybrid Drown Detection System using Computer Vision and Simulated Sensors

Inspiration:
Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental deaths, particularly among children. I remember when I was younger, I often wanted to go swimming, but I always needed my parents to supervise me. Sometimes they were too busy, and my plans to go to the pool had to be cancelled. Other times, I saw kids who went swimming without any supervision, putting themselves at serious risk. These memories made me think about how easily such accidents can happen and how technology could play a role in preventing them. This inspired me to develop a hybrid drowning detection system that combines AI-powered computer vision with simulated sensor data to detect early signs of distress in swimmers. My goal with this project is to create a tool that can assist lifeguards, or even operate autonomously to monitor swimmers and to prevent drowning accidents, especially for children like I once was.
